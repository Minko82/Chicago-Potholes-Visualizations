## üöÄ **How to Use**

### **Option 1: Run with Google Colab (Recommended)**
1. Upload the **chicago_potholes.ipynb** notebook to Google Colab
   
2. Update Altair:
   
   If you‚Äôre running the project in Google Colab, update your Altair version to avoid compatibility issues. Run the following line of code in a Colab cell:
   ```bash
   pip install -U altair vega_datasets
   ```

   After running this, go to **Runtime > Restart Runtime** in the Colab menu.

3. Run the Notebook:
   
   Execute all cells in the notebook to generate visualizations and analyze data.
